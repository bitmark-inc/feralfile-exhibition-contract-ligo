  "description": "“Our Feral File offering — the first exhibition of verse on this platform — is planted here as a seed for the poetry journal of the future, in which authorial imagination is unbounded, language and art exist in symbiosis, and every contributor is a vital force in a literary ecosystem in which connection to verse can lead to collection. In celebration of both National Poetry Month and Earth Month, the texts published here as non-fungible Tezos tokens – each a collaborative performance between writers and artists at the avant-garde of web3 poetry, including some of the planet’s most renowned voices – reflect diverse perspectives, aesthetics, and approaches to the worlds around us and inside us, always in flux. Every work invites its reader to step into a reality augmented through the art of poetry, and to engage deeply with the untamed universe of possibilities for writers on (and off) the blockchain.” — theVERSEverse",
