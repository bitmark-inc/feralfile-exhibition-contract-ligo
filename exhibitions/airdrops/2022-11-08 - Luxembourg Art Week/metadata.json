  "description": "Luxembourg Art Week has partnered with Feral File and Parallel.art to connect its audience with the field of NFTs.  To create an initial engagement with collectors, a generative art piece by Aleksandra Jovanic will be gifted by the fair to those who desire to redeem it.  This work will serve as a bridge between collectors, art fair, and Feral File, creating new interlocutors in the dialogue around NFTs and digital art.",
