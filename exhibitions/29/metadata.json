  "description": "“As a pioneer of computer art, Lee Mullican has devoted his life to finding new ways to create images. He embraced new technologies and tools of the day. In the fall of 1986, Lee Mullican participated in UCLA’s Advanced Design Research Center’s Program for Technology in the Arts. The program allowed the then 66-year-old Mullican to start exploring the digital realm. The exhibition LeeMullican.PCX presents 12 NFTs that demonstrate the artist’s relentless experimentation. Mullican is an institutionally recognized painter, he is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, among others. He skillfully used his knowledge of painterly techniques as a guide when he began working with computers and found common ground with his own style of painting and the chance made possible by the computer.” — Anika Meier",
